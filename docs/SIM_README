Included in this project is the ability to run complete simulations
for the location problems.

The simulation requires two sources of external data:

Mock packets to replace those sent by the Arduino
Mock images to replace those captured from the Pi Camera.

================================================================================


The locator needs to be initialized differently depending on whether a simulation
is being run or an actual run.


  Locator(std::string file_uri, std::string serial_id, int run_type);

is the constructor for the locator.

If running a simulation:

file_uri needs to be the fully qualified path with included / of a FOLDER which contains
images in the following format

test#.png

Images not in this format will not be read, the images need to be numbered from 0 to n where
n is the max number of images in the simulation.

serial_id needs to contain the filename and path of a text file that contains text in the following format:


{val1,val2,val3,val4,val5,val6,val7,val8}

where values are floating point numbers in the same order that they would be
expected to be sent from the Arduino.
